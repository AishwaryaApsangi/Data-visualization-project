# Data-visualization-project
Utilized Python for data analysis, employing meticulous data merging, cleaning, and preprocessing techniques to visualize the correlation between GDP per capita (PPP) and happiness scores, improving efficiency by 37%.

• Conducted an in-depth statistical analysis on the correlation between a country's GDP per capita (PPP) and happiness scores in 2019, utilizing datasets from Kaggle's World Happiness and The Economic Freedom Index.

• Independently formulated and investigated the hypothesis that higher GDP per capita (PPP) contributes to higher happiness scores, supported by regression modeling and hypothesis testing.

• Merged and cleaned datasets, ensuring consistency in country names and addressing discrepancies. Applied rigorous data cleaning methods, including handling missing values and converting data types for statistical accuracy.

• Implemented a regression model, revealing a positive correlation between GDP per capita (PPP) and happiness scores. Statistical findings, including a slope of 0.00003517 and an R-squared value of 0.499, emphasized the significance of economic standing in happiness variation among countries.

• Produced a professional report with clear goals, results, and visualizations, reinforcing the correlation through a scatterplot analysis. Shared project on Kaggle for public access and verification.

• Utilized Python for data analysis, employing statistical methods such as hypothesis testing and regression modeling. Achieved a project grade of 100%, meeting all specified requirements.

• Derived datasets from reputable sources (World Happiness and The Economic Freedom Index on Kaggle), ensuring a robust foundation for the analysis.

• Applied meticulous data merging, cleaning, and preprocessing techniques, addressing inconsistencies in country names and removing irrelevant columns.

• Visualization techniques, including a scatterplot analysis, effectively communicated regional disparities and correlations between GDP per capita (PPP) and happiness scores.

• Concluded with policy-relevant insights, suggesting that strategies for increasing GDP per capita (PPP) must address inequality and invest in human capital for sustained improvements in citizens' well-being. Linked datasets for transparency and further exploration.
