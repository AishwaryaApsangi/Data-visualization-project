COLUMN CONTENTS (df2): The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2019 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of the six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"c60b2783b77d4da38bc642318e346c41","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-h2","formattedRanges":[]},"source":["## CLEANING DATAFRAME #1 (df)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"b0daf6ecf3b6452c8d06223544ed22ee","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p","formattedRanges":[{"fromCodePoint":166,"marks":{"bold":true},"toCodePoint":248,"type":"marks"}]},"source":["The command df.info() is used to obtain a concise summary of the DataFrame df, including the number of non-null entries, data types of the columns, and memory usage.

The scatter plot clearly illustrates a positive correlation between GDP per Capita (PPP) and Happiness Score for 2019, with data points color-coded by region, demonstrating the countries in each region without a drastic skew. This suggests that higher GDP per capita (PPP) is generally associated with higher happiness scores, and the trend line emphasizes this relationship across different regions, despite some variations. Despite some countries not being included in the analysis, the graph still displays a clear trend line, indicating a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita (PPP) and the happiness scores of its citizens. The data points are distributed across all regions, suggesting that the merged dataset is sufficiently diverse and representative. This supports the conclusion that the findings from the study are likely to be reliable and applicable on a global scale, and the missing countries do not significantly distort the overall trend observed."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"a1510344609242c880e0a31a67ad1329","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-h1","formattedRanges":[{"fromCodePoint":0,"marks":{"color":"#D33800"},"toCodePoint":43,"type":"marks"}]},"source":["# 3.
